// Q21 - They think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
// I create fruit Object
let fruit = {
    name: "Apple",
    color: "Red",
    taste: "Sweet and slightly tart",
};
// print the fruit objects
console.log(`The ${fruit.name} is ${fruit.color} and the taste is ${fruit.taste}`);
